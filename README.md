# Solopreneur Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome extension I'm building to keep track of my revenue streams and social media stats in one place. Got tired of jumping between Stripe, PayPal, YouTube, and other platforms just to see how things are going, im jut looking for something simple and cheap to check the most important information.

Still pretty early in development, but the goal is to have a clean dashboard that pulls data from various APIs and gives a quick overview when I click the extension icon.

Built with vanilla JavaScript and Chrome Extension Manifest V3. Learning as I go and figuring out the best way to handle API integrations securely.

## Current Status
ðŸš§ Work in progress - basic popup and dashboard structure is there, now working on the API connectivity.
